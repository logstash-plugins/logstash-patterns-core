## 4.3.0

With **4.3.0** we're introducing a new set of pattern definitions compliant with Elastic Common Schema (ECS), on numerous 
places patterns are capturing names prescribed by the schema or use custom namespaces that do not conflict with ECS ones.

Changes are backwards compatible as much as possible and also include improvements to some of the existing patterns.

Besides fields having new names, values for numeric (integer or floating point) types are usually converted to their 
numeric representation to ease further event processing (e.g. `http.response.status_code` is now stored as an integer).

NOTE: to leverage the new ECS pattern set in Logstash a grok filter upgrade to version >= 4.4.0 is required.

- **aws**
  * in ECS mode we dropped the (incomplete) attempt to capture `rawrequest` from `S3_REQUEST_LINE`
  * `S3_ACCESS_LOG` will handle up-to-date S3 access-log formats (6 'new' field captures at the end)
    Host Id -> Signature Version -> Cipher Suite -> Authentication Type -> Host Header -> TLS version
  * `ELB_ACCESS_LOG` will handle optional (`-`) in legacy mode
  * null values such as `-` or `-1` time values (e.g. `ELB_ACCESS_LOG`'s `request_processing_time`)
    are not captured in ECS mode

- **bacula**
  - Fix: improve matching of `BACULA_HOST` as `HOSTNAME`
  - Fix: legacy `BACULA_` patterns to handle (optional) spaces
  - Fix: handle `BACULA_LOG` 'Job Id: X' prefix as optional
  - Fix: legacy matching of BACULA fatal error lines

- **bind**
  - `BIND9`'s legacy `querytype` was further split into multiple fields as:
     `dns.question.type` and `bind.log.question.flags`
  - `BIND9` patterns (legacy as well) were adjusted to handle Bind9 >= 9.11 compatibility
  - `BIND9_QUERYLOGBASE` was introduced for potential re-use

- **bro**
  * `BRO_` patterns are stricter in ECS mode - won't mistakenly match newer BRO/Zeek formats
  * place holders such as `(empty)` tags and `-` null values won't be captured
  * each `BRO_` pattern has a newer `ZEEK_` variant that supports latest Zeek 3.x versions
    e.g. `ZEEK_HTTP` as a replacement for `BRO_HTTP` (in ECS mode only),
    there's a new file **zeek** where all of the `ZEEK_XXX` pattern variants live

- **exim**
  * introduced `EXIM` (`EXIM_MESSAGE_ARRIVAL`) to match message arrival log lines - in ECS mode!

- **firewalls**
  * introduced `IPTABLES` pattern which is re-used within `SHOREWALL` and `SFW2`
  * `SHOREWALL` now supports IPv6 addresses (in ECS mode - due `IPTABLES` pattern)
  * `timestamp` fields will be captured for `SHOREWALL` and `SFW2` in legacy mode as well
  * `SHOREWALL` became less strict in containing the `kernel:` sub-string
  * `NETSCREENSESSIONLOG` properly handles optional `session_id=... reason=...` suffix
  * `interval` and `xlate_type` (legacy) CISCO fields are not captured in ECS mode

- **core** (grok-patterns)
  * `SYSLOGFACILITY` type casts facility code and priority in ECS mode
  * `SYSLOGTIMESTAMP` will be captured (from `SYSLOGBASE`) as `timestamp`
  * Fix: e-mail address's local part to match according to RFC (#273)

- **haproxy**
  * several ECS-ified fields will be type-casted to integer in ECS mode e.g. *haproxy.bytes_read*
  * fields containing null value (`-`) are no longer captured
    (e.g. in legacy mode `captured_request_cookie` gets captured even if `"-"`)

- **httpd**
  * optional fields (e.g. `http.request.referrer` or `user_agent`) are only captured when not null (`-`)
  * `source.port` (`clientport` in legacy mode) is considered optional
  * dropped raw data (`rawrequest` legacy field) in ECS mode
  * Fix: HTTPD_ERRORLOG should match when module missing (#299)

- **java**
  * `JAVASTACKTRACEPART`'s matched line number will be converted to an integer
  * `CATALINALOG` matching was updated to handle Tomcat 7/8/9 logging format
  * `TOMCATLOG` handles the default Tomcat 7/8/9 logging format
  * old (custom) legacy TOMCAT format is handled by the added `TOMCATLEGACY_LOG`
  * `TOMCATLOG` and `TOMCAT_DATESTAMP` still match the legacy format, 
      however this might change at a later point - if you rely on the old format use `TOMCATLEGACY_` patterns

- **junos**
  * integer fields (e.g. `juniper.srx.elapsed_time`) are captured as integer values

- **linux-syslog**
  * `SYSLOG5424LINE` captures (overwrites) the `message` field instead of using a custom field name
  * regardless of the format used, in ECS mode, timestamps are always captured as `timestamp`
  * fields such as `log.syslog.facility.code` and `process.pid` are converted to integers

- **mcollective**
  * *mcollective-patterns* file was removed, it's all one *mcollective* in ECS mode
  * `MCOLLECTIVE`'s `process.pid` (`pid` previously) is not type-casted to an integer

- **nagios**
  * numeric fields such as `nagios.log.attempt` are converted to integer values in ECS mode

- **rails**
  * request duration times from `RAILS3` log will be converted to floating point values

- **squid**
  * `SQUID3`'s `duration` http.response `status_code` and `bytes` are type-casted to int
  * `SQUID3` pattern won't capture null ('-') `user.name` or `squid.response.content_type`
  * Fix: allow to parse SQUID log with status 0 (#298)
  * Fix: handle optional server address (#298)

## 4.2.0
  - Fix: Java stack trace's JAVAFILE to better match generated names
  - Fix: match Information/INFORMATION in LOGLEVEL [#274](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/274)
  - Fix: NAGIOS TIMEPERIOD unknown (from/to) field matching [#275](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/275)
  - Fix: HTTPD access log parse failure on missing response [#282](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/282)
  - Fix: UNIXPATH to avoid DoS on long paths with unmatching chars [#292](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/292)

    For longer paths, a non matching character towards the end of the path would cause the RegExp engine a long time to abort.
    With this change we're also explicit about not supporting relative paths (using the `PATH` pattern), these won't be properly matched.
 
  - Feat: allow UNIXPATH to match non-ascii chars [#291](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/291)
